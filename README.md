In this project i created a global state management with react context and hooks.

Dude! :). I love this example.  This is forked from Mohamad Hosein Hamzenejad.

Let's keep it going. So I am going to implement:

Readme Driven Development
=========================

Problem
-------

Build out this example in a way that continues to teach by the way how minimal it is.

Solution
--------
Add some modules and create each one as a version that builds on the previous.  Still, each version can be picked off and run by itself.

THIS Readme
------

* Must not be complete.
* Designed to be read by the user.

You get
-------
* documentation (nicer than afterwards)
* a chance to think about the software
* guideline for the implementation
* describe the interface. others could start working
* basis for discussion
* no limits for your ideas - paper and brain
